# L22-Compiler

L22 is an unstructured imperative programming language. One of the language's goals is to enable easy readability, and as such, it places strong restrictions on the formatting and positioning of code within lines (indentation). This particular project was an integral part of the Compilers bachelor's course during the academic year 2021/2022 @ IST.
